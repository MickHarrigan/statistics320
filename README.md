# Statistics Course Projects

This is a collection of my MATLAB scripts and reports about the findings within each project of the course.

In the first project I was a bit messy with my creation and tracking, while the others generally followed the methodology of
using Emacs Org mode and converting `.org` files directly into pdfs.

Each is an example of professional writing and problem solving and using LATEX in a manner to convey that.
