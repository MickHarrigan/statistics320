* Useful Information for Writing :noexport:
** No Indentation / Line Skips
noindent is used for removing the paragraph indentation that is used on each separated section.
\noindent
This is generally preceeded by \bigskip to space things out a little better


** Figure Creation
This is how a figure is created, gives a caption and a name, then a link to the file itself, based on the relative path.
#+caption: Scatterplot of the values of R using equation 1
#+name: fig:RScatterplot
[[./Images/ScatterplotR1.jpg]]


it is called through use of the [[]] linking format and using the field in the name section from above.

** Equation Creation
Uses the latex headers of
\begin{equation} and \end{equation}
can be named and captioned with #+name and #+caption like figures above.
They are automatically numbered (and no numbers can be applied if equation is replaced with equation*)

Inline equations are wrapped with $ characters. Formatting equations can be stolen from former works, or alternatively (and preferably) use something like EqualX

** Table Creation
Creates a table with name, alignment, caption.
Inline latex can be used with \ key. DO NOT USE ANYTHING WITH | KEY, BREAKS THE FORMATTING.
#+caption: Expected values of both random variable S and respective function of R
#+name: tab:ExpectedVals
#+ATTR_LATEX: :align |c|c|c|c|
|--------+-----------------+--------+---------|
| Method | Function of R   |   E[S] | E[g(R)] |
|--------+-----------------+--------+---------|
|      1 | R, R \geq 0     | 1.0010 |  0.0022 |
|      2 | \lvert R \rvert | 1.9997 |  0.0022 |
|      3 | R^2             | 4.5529 |  0.0000 |

** Multifig Stuff
Example of having a multiple, side by side figure is shown here below

#+caption: Sum of iid Uniform Random Variables for N = 2,6,12
#+name: fig:UniformSubFig
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subfloat[label 1]{{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./Images/fig1.jpg} }}
    \subfloat[label 2]{{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./Images/fig2.jpg} }}
\end{figure}
